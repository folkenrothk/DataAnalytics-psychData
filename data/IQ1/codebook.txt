This experimental IQ test had 25 items, each an matrix with one tile missing and eight possibilities for that tile.

The items are /questions/ folder, in subfolders 1...25 which correspond to Q1....Q25 in the data file. In the folder for each question you will find the files:

q.png - the incomplete matrix.
1.png.....7.png - wrong answers
a.png - the right answer.

In the data file, if Q1 is 4, that means they chose 4.png as their answer. If it is 10, that means they chose a.png as their answer.

At the end they were also directed to indicate:

gender - chosen from a drop down list where 1=male, 2=female, 3=other.
age - entered as free response (ages < 18 removed)

NOTES:

1. The possible answers were presented in two rows of four with a random order for each participant.

2. The collection of this data was of mediocre quality.
